## Summary

Highly motivated engineer, graduated in Computer and Automation Engineering at Marche Polytechnic University (Marche, Italy), semester abroad at Augsburg University of Applied Sciences (Bayern, Germany), intern at The Qt Company (Oslo, Norway) during the Google Summer of Code program. 

I am a prospective graduate of MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Università di Bologna. I came from strong theoretical background in all the basic fields of Engineering (Mathematics, Electronics, Computer Science and Systems Theory).

My self-motivation and passion for engineering always makes me seek for outstanding results in my professional career as well as in my hobbies.
