## Summary

I am an MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bologna with a knowledge of several Automation disciplines and strong expertise in Computer Engineering.

During my Bachelor of Engineering, I had the chance to be an exchange student at the Augsburg University of Applied Sciences (Bayern, Germany). 

In the past I took part of the Google Summer of Code project, I developed open source software with The Qt Company - which requires learners to think analytically, creatively, and collaboratively. (strengthening my self-management skills). 

With a profoundly curious personality, eclecticism and originality are the attitudes I value the most. I love to be involved in challenging and innovative projects both within and without my area of expertise. I am always eager to put into practice what I learn. 

My self-motivation and passion for engineering always makes me seek for outstanding results in my professional career as well as in my hobbies.

## Projects

**Kalman Filter and Deep Learning Algorithms for SoC Estimation**<span class="role"></span> <span class="right">2019.03 - 2019.07</span><br>

- This project focused on assessment of three methods State Of Charge (SOC) estimation for Lithium-Ion battery in terms of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Open-Circuit Voltage (OCV) **(Matlab/Simulink, LaTex, Microsoft Office)**.

**Computational complexity in Algorithms for Solving Linear Systems**<span class="role"></span><span class="right">2018.03 - 2018.07</span><br>

- The project aimed to develop and analyze the main algorithms for solving system of linear equations. In particular was focused in Gauss–Seidel, Jacobi (iterative methods) and Gauss Elimination (direct method) **(C++, Linux, LaTex)**.
