Highly motivated engineer, good team work ability. I always try to learn new skills and improve myself to solve problems increasingly more challenging. In the past I took part of the Google Summer of Code project, I developed open source software - which requires learners to think analytically, creatively, and collaboratively. (strengthening my self-management skills). In the future I would like to find a work environment where I can test myself every day growing up and having a role of greater responsibility in order to improve, with my skills, people's lives.

- Job performed inside the Google Summer of Code 2018 program.
- Designed and developed the feature-parity between the QtLocation module and the GeoJSON standard.
- Added GeoJSON interoperability to Qt framework by developing a paresr for QtPositioning API.
- Team working using the collaboration and revision tools (CI/CD).
- Reviewed by the community and submitted **(Git, Gerrit Code Review, Documentation Review)**.

## Projects

**Kalman Filter and Deep Learning Algorithms for SoC Estimation**<span class="role"></span> <span class="right">2019.03 - 2019.07</span><br>

- This project focused on assessment of three methods State Of Charge (SOC) estimation for Lithium-Ion battery in terms of Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Open-Circuit Voltage (OCV) **(Matlab/Simulink, LaTex, Microsoft Office)**.

**Computational complexity in Algorithms for Solving Linear Systems**<span class="role"></span><span class="right">2018.03 - 2018.07</span><br>

- The project aimed to develop and analyze the main algorithms for solving system of linear equations. In particular was focused in Gauss–Seidel, Jacobi (iterative methods) and Gauss Elimination (direct method) **(C++, Linux, LaTex)**.
